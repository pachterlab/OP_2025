# OP_2025

Notebooks for reproducing all figures and analysis in the ** preprint. 

## Getting Started

All analysis notebooks, saved as .ipynb's in analysis scripts, can be run from Google Colab. Colab links are included in every notebook. 

All saved/processed data used for analysis is streamed to the notebooks from [CaltechData](https://data.caltech.edu/).
